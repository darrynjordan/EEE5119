Knowing this, convolve each received signal in the matrix with the matched filter i.e. perform pulse compression. Implement this filter at 11, commenting out `pc_matrix = rx_matrix` from earlier. Tip: time domain convolution is equivalent to frequency domain multiplication. Re-run all the cells to see the benefit of pulse compression, especially in the RDM."
