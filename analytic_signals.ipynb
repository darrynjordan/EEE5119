    "The negative frequency components of real-valued signals are superfluous, due to the Hermitian symmetry of the spectrum. These negative frequency components can be discarded with no loss of information, provided one is willing to deal with a complex-valued signal instead. By definition, a complex-valued signal that has no negative frequency components is called an analytic signal. It is often more desirable to work with the analytic representation of real-valued signals, since it makes certain attributes of the signal more accessible, such as instantaneous amplitude, instantaneous phase, and instantaneous power.\n",

    "$$ s(t) = \\cos (2 \\pi ft) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ t $ represents time and where $f$ is the frequency in Hz. At any given point in time $ t $, the value of $\\cos(2 \\pi ft)$ is simply the instantaneous amplitude of the signal. Determination of both the signal phase and power require observation of the signal over multiple points in time. The analytic representation of a signal does not have this constraint."

    "#### Definition\n",
    "The analytic representation $\\tilde{s}(t)$ of a signal $s(t)$ is defined as the sum of itself and $i$ times its Hilbert transform i.e., the analytic representation of a signal can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{s}(t) = s(t) + i \\mathcal{H} \\left( s(t) \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{H} \\left( s(t) \\right)$ is the Hilbert transform of $s(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hilbert transform of a signal is defined as the signal in which all frequency components of the original signal have their phase shifted by $ 90 \\degree $. For the example cosine function, which by definition consists of a single frequency component,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{H} \\left( \\cos (2 \\pi ft) \\right) = \\cos (2 \\pi ft - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin (2 \\pi ft) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the analytic representation of the example signal is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{s}(t) = \\cos (2 \\pi ft) + i \\sin (2 \\pi ft) = e^{i 2 \\pi f t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the last equality is Eulerâ€™s formula, $ e^{ix} = \\cos (x) + i \\sin (x)$. It is this complex exponential form $e^{i 2 \\pi ft}$ that is used widely in digital signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put plainly, the Hilbert transform produces a signal which serves to negate all negative frequency components and double all positive components when added to the original signal, such that the total signal energy is preserved."
